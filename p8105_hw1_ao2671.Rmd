# creating a dataframe with a sample from normal distribution, logical, cahracter and factor vectors
library(tidyverse)
data_frame = tibble(

  vec_norm_distr = rnorm(10), 
  
  vec_logical = vec_norm_distr>0,
  
  vec_char =  c ("first","second","third","forth","fifth","sixth","seventh","eighth","ninth","tenth"),

# convert logical vector to numeric
as.numeric(data_frame$vec_logical)
# convert character vector to numeric
as.numeric(data_frame$vec_char)
# convert factor vector to numeric
as.numeric(data_frame$vec_factor)

#logical variables can be converted to numbers where 1 is TRUE and 0 is FALSE, 
#factor can be converted to numbers according to the number of levels 
#and character variables cannot be converted to numbers. 
#This is why we can take the mean of logical variable but not for character variables. 
#Logical variables have to be converted to numeric prior to taking the mean
